# The Ultimate Tour

This repo contains the code/shiny app for the test app I created when learning Shiny and R.

UI.R & Server.R contain the Shiny App/code.

The original code book with documentation is available on [Rpub](https://rpubs.com/leehbi/tour)

The live app can be found [here](http://leehbi.shinyapps.io/Tour/) although you'll need API keys for Yelp.
